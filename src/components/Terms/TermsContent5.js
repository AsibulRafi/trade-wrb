          <h4>1. General Terms</h4>

            at No name 1, some might be made available at certain points only.
            Direct engagement:No name 1 and the user engage in this contract by
            their own free will, as individuals, entities or a related party. If
            this is not the case, it should be put into a written explanation.No
            name 1 will not verify and accept any user actions which have not
            been approved and shared with beforehand. The user provides his
            consent to provide No name 1 with any relevant information that
            might be requested. Margin: We`ve already stated that the usage of
            the platform might include some margined transactions, that might
            need the customer to put funds to meet the obligations stated in the
            agreement. There isn`t any solicitation: Frankfurtfx has never
            encouraged or suggested in any way and form that users should engage
            in any transactions or make a purchase of an asset. Also, No name 1
            is not liable for the same actions done by any 3rd parties related
            to the platform. Mistakes: There are many things that might result
            in an error in the quotation, along with 3rd parties and other
            things. No name 1 keeps its privilege to make changes to an account
            balance if there happens to be a payment a mistake in the quotation.
            If there is a disagreement regarding such a mistake or change, it
            will be corrected according to the fair market price of the given
            asset at the time the mistake happened. Making Payments: the
            standard procedure is that any funds transferred by the user or a
            party related to or authorized by the user, and also any other
            payments and taxes charged from the user profile, will all go to the
            same account, which is the user`s trading profile. Note that there
            might be some extra charges applicable, up to $15 per transfer.
            However, prior to processing the payment, Frankfurtfx must verify
            that the person making the deposit is the real user of that account.
            In case this is not true, No name 1 can decide to cancel the
            transfer. No name 1 is not liable for any money not deposited
            straight to an account on the platform. Market volatilities: There
            are many things which are beyond No name 1 level of prediction and
            control, such as economic disruptions, war outbreak, global crisis,
            forces of nature and so on. Therefore the user agrees about the
            possibility for instant market disruptions which can result in loss
            of capital. No name 1 has the privilege to stop or negate any
            transfer or place some restrictions in order, to terminate a user
            profile, all in case of unnatural or extraordinary market
            occurrences. Minimal trading length: Any investment which gets
            closed after 2 minutes after it`s started will be considered to be
            scalping. Frankfurtfx holds the privilege to nullify such
            investments without having to give any notice. Index investment: By
            using the platform, the user provides his confirmation of awareness
            regarding the Contract for Difference. It states that No name 1
            shall begin a trade as late as 5 minutes after the certain market
            has been opened. No name 1 holds the privilege to deny a trade of a
            relevant asset within those 5 initial minutes. Also, No name 1 can
            decide to terminate or not process any trade request during those 5
            minutes.

            ensuring the necessary funds for the outstanding safety leeway
            before starting a trade, it does not mean that the user`s dues have

            might exchange user funds into a different currency, at a rate
            favorable for the platform in order to cover some user liabilities
            or credits. No name 1 can start or end any trades without having to
            inform the user before that and cover any user obligations towards
